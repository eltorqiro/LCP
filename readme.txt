Eclipse project notes
---------------------
Included is the .project, .settings and .buildpath for an Eclipse project.
When importing into Eclipse, make sure the folder is the same name as the project name
otherwise it will throw an error about overlap.  Alternatively, manually modify the .project
file to change the <name/> element to whatever folder you are importing to before you import.
